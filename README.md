This project performs customer segmentation for an e-commerce business using a complete data science approach, from data ingestion and feature engineering to creating a clustering model and deploying it as an interactive web application. The application runs 100% in the browser with PyScript, requiring no back-end.

## üöÄ Live Demo

The interactive web application is published using GitHub Pages and can be accessed at the link below:

**[https://ygorsmc.github.io/RFM-Customer-Segmentation/](https://ygorsmc.github.io/RFM-Customer-Segmentation/)**

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-Time Segmentation:** An interactive interface to input a customer's Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) data and instantly discover their segment.
* **Browser-Side Execution:** The entire process, including loading the Machine Learning model and scaler, is handled on the client-side with PyScript.
* **Realistic Data Flow:** The project simulates a real-world environment where data is extracted from a SQL database (SQLite) instead of a static CSV file.
* **Segment Interpretation:** The clusters generated by the model are translated into meaningful business "personas" (e.g., "Best Customers," "At-Risk Customers").

## üß† Project Flow and Methodology

The project followed a structured workflow to ensure the quality of the analysis and the final model.

1.  **Data Sourcing and Ingestion:** The "E-Commerce Data Set" from the UCI repository was downloaded from Kaggle. To simulate a production environment, the `.csv` file was converted and loaded into a local **SQLite** database (`ecommerce.db`).

2.  **Feature Engineering (RFM Analysis):** To create meaningful features for clustering, the **RFM** marketing methodology was applied:
    * **Recency (R):** Days since the customer's last purchase.
    * **Frequency (F):** The total number of purchases made by the customer.
    * **Monetary (M):** The total amount of money spent by the customer.

3.  **K-Means Clustering Model:**
    * The RFM data was scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features had equal importance for the algorithm.
    * The **Elbow Method** was used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K=4).
    * The **K-Means** model was trained to group customers into the 4 identified segments.

4.  **Deployment:**
    * The trained `StandardScaler` and `KMeans` model were saved together in a single (`.joblib`) file.
    * A web interface was built with HTML/CSS and PyScript to load these artifacts and perform real-time segmentation in the browser.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Analysis and Modeling:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Database:** SQLite (with SQLAlchemy for connection)
* **Frontend and Deployment:** HTML5, CSS3, PyScript

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running Locally

To test the application on your machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME
    ```
3.  **Start a local server:**
    Since PyScript needs to fetch the `.joblib` and `.db` files, a local server is required. With Python installed, use:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
4.  **Access in your browser:**
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
